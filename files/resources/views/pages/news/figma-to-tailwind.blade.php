    <p class="lead">For years the end of a project looked the same: a tidy Figma file, a call to walk through it, and a slow realisation over the next six weeks that what shipped was a cover version of what we drew. So we stopped handing off.</p>

    <h2>The handoff is where the design goes to die</h2>

    <p>Not because engineers are careless — because a static file cannot answer questions. What happens at 900px? What does this do while it loads? What if the name is forty characters? A Figma frame answers none of that, so every one of those decisions gets made again, quickly, by someone who was not in the room when the first one was made.</p>

    <p>Multiply that by a few hundred small decisions and you get a site that is recognisably the design, and unmistakably not it.</p>

    <h2>Figma is for deciding. Tailwind is for building.</h2>

    <p>We still design in Figma, because it is the fastest place on earth to be wrong. Ten directions in an afternoon, thrown away by dinner. That is the job.</p>

    <p>But once a direction is real, we stop drawing it and start building it. The design system lands as tokens and components, not as a page of specs:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Type, spacing, and colour become theme variables — one source, not a swatch to eyeball</li>
        <li>Components ship as markup your team already knows how to read</li>
        <li>The edge cases get decided while we are still the ones holding them</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Your engineers get components, not screenshots — and the handoff meeting stops being a negotiation.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>What actually changed</h2>

    <p>Three things, consistently. Launches got faster, because the last mile was already walked. Reviews got calmer, because we were arguing about the real thing in a real browser instead of about a picture of it. And the work stopped drifting after we left, because the rules lived in the codebase rather than in our heads.</p>

    <h2>The catch</h2>

    <p>It only works if the designers can actually write the markup. That is a hiring constraint, not a process one, and it is the main reason we have stayed four people. A design engineer who can take a direction from sketch to production is rare, and worth more than three of anything else.</p>
